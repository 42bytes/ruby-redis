This project was started because I needed an authenticating and routable
proxy for Redis.  Special attention was paid to performance of the basic
Redis protocol.  All of the magic is in buftok.rb.  This same parser can
be used for both clients and servers/proxies/routers.

Client benchmark:
Ruby Redis with hiredis enabled (rr+hiredis) performs about the same
as em-hiredis. The slight difference is some parameter handling I'm
not sure will be changed.  The pure Ruby implementation of the wire
protocol (ruby-redis) is only slightly slower. My laptop with Ruby 1.9
pipelining get operations to a C Redis 2.2 server:

The server has the complete command set except for anything that needs
save and load to work.  Having a complete command set allows me to
extensively test buftok.rb against the C Redis test suite (in TCL).

I'm available to help if anyone wants to tackle saving and loading.
Replication is pretty easy to add once that is working.  There's no
technical reason this hasn't been done, it's just a very low priority.
These features are all that we need to have a complete server in Ruby.

Server benchmark:
Note that this is 32-bit Ruby vs 32-bit Redis.
